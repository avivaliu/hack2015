Although the weather can be chilly and damp, the hotels full and the streets clogged with revelers, the sight of the delicate blossoms and their intoxicating effect on the people make for a wonderful experience. I had thought it was sentimental hype until I found myself in Kyoto one year during the height of cherry blossom season."
